DecentralAI is a platform that enables personal data to be securely harnessed for AI without compromising privacy. Today, vast amounts of valuable data go to waste because people cannot share it safely. With Oasis ROFL TEE technology, we ensure that sensitive data is processed in a confidential environment while still unlocking its potential for AI.

Users can upload their files to contribute to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The data is transformed into embeddings, stored as encrypted vector-db snapshots on IPFS, and then used to enrich the knowledge of an LLM. Throughout the process, data never leaves the protected TEE environment unencrypted.


**Key Benefits**

 - Confidential computation with GPU & socket support → secure and
   performant. 
 - Web3 storage (IPFS) → transparency and decentralization.
 - Data ownership & monetization → individuals retain control and can
   capture value from their contributions.

**Tech Stack:**

 - Smart contracts: Solidity, Hardhat 
 - Frontend: Next.js 
 - Blockchain: Rise chain 
 - Extras: Oasis ROFL
